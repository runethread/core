# Architecture Decision Records

Runethread uses Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for durable architectural choices that affect compatibility, trust, security, state ownership, or component boundaries.

The architecture documents describe the target system. Accepted decisions govern implementation until they are explicitly superseded.

## Status values

- **Proposed** — under review; implementation must not assume it is final.
- **Accepted** — current architectural decision.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a newer ADR that explains why.
- **Rejected** — considered and intentionally not adopted.

ADR-014 amends the initial GitHub-Actions-backed implementation profile described in ADR-012/ADR-013. Their candidate-before-canonical, independent-audit, exact-revision publication, idempotency, stale-reprepare, and per-repository serialization invariants remain accepted.

ADR-015 records a required **next-contract** semantic change. Contract v8 remains immutable and continues to require relevant project current-state synchronization until a repository is explicitly migrated to the contract release implementing ADR-015.

ADR-016 hardens the Phase 2.6 hosted boundary. It makes the ADR-015 projection-capable contract a normal hosted-write admission prerequisite, separates finalizer/auditor evidence-write capabilities, pins live evidence against premature retention/GC, and replaces the unproven Worker-only REST-ref-CAS assumption with a concrete minimal Git publisher executor unless a future GitHub API proves true expected-old ref CAS.

ADR-017 further hardens the same hosted profile. Ordinary out-of-band adoption must preserve the last accepted canonical revision in ancestry so committed Git/idempotency evidence is not erased; directly observed private repository visibility becomes a live hosted-write eligibility condition; `PUBLISHING` remains fenced until all issued publisher capabilities for the generation are quiesced; and the managed memory validation-workflow trigger transition must ship through the released upgrader/downstream migration rather than ordinary provider writes. Where older ADR-014/ADR-016 recovery/publication wording is less strict, ADR-017 controls.

ADR-018 closes the remaining indeterminate-publication/history gap. A candidate that is proven or possibly published remains a protected history anchor until publication and ancestry are resolved; a later current-ref read cannot erase that fact, and ordinary descendant adoption from an older accepted base is forbidden while it could exclude a previously committed candidate. Where ADR-017 reconciliation considered only the last accepted base revision, ADR-018 controls.

ADR-019 makes destructive hosted-state rollback explicit. A rollback-independent append-only safety journal in the existing private evidence boundary preserves accepted promises, cancellation decisions, accepted canonical anchors, and publication intents across Durable Object PITR/recreation without becoming a second live state machine. It also requires immutable full-SHA pins in the retained managed private-memory Actions workflow and makes the v9 support/README migration agree with ADR-015 without silently overwriting customized support files. Where older ADR-014 through ADR-018 wording assumes forward-only Durable Object storage, ADR-019 controls recovery.

ADR-020 strengthens the independent prepublication audit. Candidate validity, parent/request metadata, fresh indexes, and path scope are not enough to prove the finalizer actually applied the sealed request. Before exact `C` can be published, a fresh auditor must use Core-owned mutation semantics against exact `H0` + the immutable sealed request to prove the candidate's semantic bytes and Core mutation metadata conform to that request. This remains a second execution of the same Core semantics rather than a second semantic implementation.

ADR-021 closes the remaining finalizer-result bypass around ADR-020. `NO_OP` and `ALREADY_COMMITTED` are successful terminal semantic claims which can skip candidate publication, so a finalizer receipt alone cannot make them authoritative. Before either result becomes durable client-visible success or releases the lane, a fresh reduced-privilege Core/repository verification must independently prove the exact no-op or canonical committed-idempotency result and bind it in immutable rollback-recoverable terminal-success evidence. Unsuccessful/stale execution results do not require equivalent semantic replay because the architecture does not claim availability against a compromised finalizer.

ADR-022 closes the remaining exact-candidate object-envelope gap. The published commit object itself is canonical state, so author/committer identity, timestamps, headers, and reachable object closure cannot remain ambient finalizer/Git inputs once ADR-020 treats the finalizer as untrusted. Hosted candidate construction now uses a deterministic Core-owned commit envelope derived from exact `H0` + sealed request + pinned release, sanitizes Git environment/config inputs, and requires the fresh auditor to prove the raw exact commit object and exact expected `C` identity. Finalizer-supplied unreachable Git objects are not part of the authorized candidate and must not be uploaded merely because they were packaged.

ADR-023 generalizes rollback-safe terminalization across the entire hosted lifecycle. Any client-visible terminal result which stops an accepted operation or releases its serialized lane position must first have a minimized immutable rollback-independent terminal-disposition record. Candidate `COMMITTED`, ADR-021 `NO_OP`/`ALREADY_COMMITTED`, `NEEDS_REPREPARE`, request-local failures, deterministic terminal audit failures, and cancellation therefore cannot be forgotten by Durable Object PITR and resurrected as live work. This adds durability to unsuccessful outcomes without adding a second semantic verifier for failures.

## ADR format

Each ADR contains:

```text
# ADR-NNN: title

Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What problem or constraint requires a durable decision?

## Decision
What are we choosing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier, harder, required, or intentionally unsupported?

## Alternatives considered
What credible alternatives were rejected and why?

## Verification
How can implementation/tests demonstrate compliance?
```

## Rules

1. ADRs record architectural decisions, not ordinary implementation details.
2. Accepted ADRs should not be silently edited to reverse their meaning; supersede them with a new ADR.
3. Compatibility- or security-affecting code changes should cite the relevant ADR in the PR/commit description.
4. Released Runethread contracts remain immutable historical authority for repositories pinned to them until an explicit supported migration changes that repository's contract state.
