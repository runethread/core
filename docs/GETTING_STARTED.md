# Getting started with Runethread

Runethread gives an AI assistant durable, user-owned memory backed by ordinary Git files.

The public implementation is `runethread/core`. Actual personal memory belongs in a separate private repository, conventionally named `runethread-memory`.

For most users, the preferred setup is the AI-first flow in `README.md` and `AI_SETUP.md`. The CLI remains the deterministic local initialization, validation, search, index, and migration tool.

## Requirements

For a prebuilt release binary:

- Git is recommended;
- a private Git remote such as GitHub/GitLab is recommended for durable remote storage;
- the AI client needs authorized access to the private memory repository.

Go is not required for a prebuilt binary. Go is required only when installing/building from source. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is optional.

## 1. Install Runethread

Download an official release binary and verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt` when practical.

On Windows, running `runethread-windows-amd64.exe` without arguments launches the first-run wizard. It asks for a target directory (default `runethread-memory`), creates a native repository, initializes Git when available, and prints the remaining private-remote/AI-access steps.

Install with Go from an immutable release tag:

```bash
go install github.com/runethread/core/cmd/runethread@<release-tag>
```

For development only:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runethread/core.git
cd core
go build -o runethread ./cmd/runethread
```

## 2. Initialize a private memory repository

```bash
mkdir runethread-memory
cd runethread-memory
git init
runethread init .
```

`runethread init` refuses to overwrite a non-empty directory; a directory containing only `.git` is allowed.

A native contract-v9 repository contains:

- `MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md` — mandatory operating rules;
- `docs/USER_COMMANDS.md` — the `store/search` contract;
- `docs/EXTENDING_RUNETHREAD.md` — taxonomy/schema-extension rules;
- `docs/INDEX_FORMAT.md` — deterministic Index v2 layout;
- `schema/` and `templates/` — memory structure;
- `memories/` — canonical atomic memories;
- `projects/` — non-authoritative project orientation/materialized views plus user project context;
- `index/` — generated retrieval acceleration;
- `.runethread/config.json` — compatibility/version metadata;
- `.runethread/lock.json` — immutable contract-release pin and control-plane digests;
- `.gitattributes` — managed LF text policy for byte-stable Git checkouts;
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — read-only pull-request/manual trust/bootstrap validation workflow.

Under contract v9, `runethread_version` in config/lock identifies the **contract release**. It does not have to equal the version of a newer compatible runtime executing against the repository.

Project current-state/overview files are orientation views rather than authoritative sources under contract v9. They may lag a newly committed atomic memory or authoritative project-source change. Atomic-memory completion does not require synchronizing those views; when current-state retrieval depends on them, check their freshness and fall back to canonical memories and the authoritative project source when stale, unknown, or conflicting.

## 3. Create a private remote

Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize Runethread memory repository"
gh repo create runethread-memory --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

Or create an empty **private** repository in the Git host UI and push normally.

Keep the repository private unless you intentionally choose to publish its contents.

## 4. Give the AI authorized repository access

Use the AI client's official Git-provider connection/authorization UI so it can read and, when desired, write the private repository.

Never paste GitHub passwords, PATs, OAuth tokens, session cookies, SSH private keys, or equivalent credentials into chat.

Runethread itself does not require a hosted server and does not receive the user's memory data when used purely locally/offline. Future hosted delivery components have separate data-handling and trust boundaries documented by their release.

## 5. Use Runethread from conversations

The two primary user commands are:

```text
Runethread: store ...
Runethread: search ...
```

Examples:

```text
Runethread: store that I prefer verified outputs before claims of coding success.
Runethread: search for my standing coding preferences.
```

`store` means durable write. `search` is retrieval-only.

Deterministic local search is also available:

```bash
runethread search --root . "standing coding preferences"
```

A full UUID uses the exact-ID shard route; ordinary text uses Index v2's inverted term index.

## 6. Organize memories without changing the schema

Most categories belong in flexible retrieval metadata: projects, topics, tags, aliases, and entities.

```text
Runethread: store this under the topic home-automation.
```

Adding a core memory `type` is different because it changes semantic behavior and may require schema/validator/migration work. Normal memory operators must not invent a ninth core type or edit the pinned schema as a routine write. See `docs/EXTENDING_RUNETHREAD.md`.

## 7. Upgrade or migrate a repository

Native repositories remain pinned to their installed contract release until an explicit contract upgrade:

```bash
runethread upgrade .
```

A newer runtime-only release that embeds the same contract does not require running `upgrade`, rewriting `.runethread`, or committing a repository repin merely to record the runtime version.

Runethread v0.9.0 / contract 9 explicitly supports exact historical native v0.6.0 and v0.7.0 contract-v7 source anchors, exact v0.8.0 contract-v8 source state, plus the deliberately narrow exact trusted GitMemo v0.5.0 predecessor state. Historical source state is verified before current managed files are written.

The v8 -> v9 migration changes operational project-view semantics and managed support/bootstrap state without changing memory schema, repository format, index format, or project-view representation. Existing project current-state/overview bytes are preserved.

The current upgrader:

1. detects native versus supported legacy metadata and refuses mixed state;
2. verifies an exact supported source anchor, including managed filesystem-object safety;
3. refuses conflicting custom managed support such as a non-matching `.gitattributes` or validation workflow;
4. replaces README support prose only when the source README exactly matches a recognized prior managed Runethread/GitMemo state, preserving customized README bytes;
5. snapshots only managed/generated regular-file paths needed for rollback;
6. writes current `.runethread` metadata and pinned contract release;
7. preserves canonical `memories/`, `projects/`, and unrelated user files;
8. rebuilds Index v2;
9. validates the resulting repository; and
10. restores the snapshot on a hard post-write failure.

The v9 managed GitHub validation workflow no longer runs a redundant full validation on every normal `push`; it retains pull-request and manual validation and pins retained external Actions to immutable full commit SHAs.

## 8. Filesystem-object integrity

Contract v8 and later contracts retain the fail-closed authoritative filesystem-object boundary. Symbolic links and unsupported special filesystem objects are rejected when they are used as repository-owned canonical/control-plane/index-source authority. Authoritative directories must be real directories and authoritative files must be regular files; traversal and volume escapes are invalid.

This is separate from content hashing: a symbolic link pointing at bytes that happen to match a trusted file is still not a valid authoritative repository object.

## 9. Index freshness and validation

```bash
runethread index --check .
runethread validate .
```

After a write affecting indexed metadata:

```bash
runethread index --write .
runethread index --check .
runethread validate .
```

If a write-capable client cannot run the indexer, preserve or create the standard stale marker:

```bash
runethread index --mark-stale .
```

A stale index is degraded discovery, not loss of canonical memory. Use repository search/valid canonical sidecars until deterministic regeneration succeeds. Unsafe authoritative filesystem objects are integrity errors, not ordinary index staleness.

## Privacy and security

Runethread is not a secrets vault. Do not store passwords, API tokens, private keys, recovery codes, session credentials, banking credentials, or other authentication secrets.

The user's memory repository is user-owned plain Git data. The public project contains tooling and release contracts, not personal memories.
